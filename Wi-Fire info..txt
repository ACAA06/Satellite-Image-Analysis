WIFIRE is an integrated system for wildfire analysis, 
with specific regard to changing urban dynamics and climate. The system integrates networked observations such as heterogeneous 
satellite data and real-time remote sensor data,
 with computational techniques in signal processing, visualization, modeling,
 and data assimilation to provide a scalable method to monitor such phenomena as 
weather patterns that can help predict a wildfire's rate of spread.

The products of WIFIRE will be initially disseminated to project collaborators 
(SDG&E, CAL FIRE, USFS) covering academic, private, 
and government laboratories while generating value to emergency officials,
 and consequently to the general public.

WIFIRE may be used by government agencies in the future to save lives 
and property during wildfire events, test the effectiveness of response and 
evacuation scenarios before they occur 
and assess the effectiveness of high-density sensor networks in improving fire and weather predictions. 
WIFIRE's high-density network, therefore, will serve as a testbed for future applications worldwide.
The team is inclusive across a spectrum of collaborators 
and will create an open-source CI environment with intuitive workflows that lead to 
reusable software components for a wide range of science and engineering disciplines
 that can be extended to secondary education. 
Results are disseminated via an interactive website at SDSC in which students 
from high school to graduate level can participate in uploading their own data logging,
 data processing or data-driven alerts.
